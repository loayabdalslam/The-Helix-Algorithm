# Electron-Orbital Like Pathways for Neural Optimization: The Helix Algorithm

## Overview
The **Helix Algorithm** introduces a novel approach to hyperparameter optimization inspired by the behavior of an electron orbiting around a nucleus. By dynamically spiraling through the optimization landscape, the Helix Algorithm converges efficiently to global minima while maintaining a balance between computational efficiency and interpretability.

This repository accompanies the paper *Electron-Orbital Like Pathways for Neural Optimization: The Helix Algorithm* by Loai A. Alazab, Hamdy W. Abd-Elhalim, and Omar M. Mounir.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight Framework**: Minimal computational overhead with broad adaptability across data types.
- **Orbital Mechanism**: A spiral-inspired trajectory combines exploration and exploitation to escape local minima and saddle points.
- **Versatile Applications**: Performs well in structured and unstructured data tasks such as regression, clustering, and classification.
- **Comparison Results**: Benchmarks against popular optimizers like Adam, SGD, and PSO demonstrate Helixâ€™s superior performance in various tasks.

## Core Contributions
1. **Orbital Trajectory**: Inspired by electron orbits, enabling efficient optimization through a dynamic spiral mechanism.
2. **Interpretability**: Transparent updates offer insights into the optimization process, reducing the "black-box" nature of traditional optimizers.
3. **Broad Applications**: Adaptable for various datasets, including:
   - Boston Housing (regression)
   - MNIST (image classification)
   - Iris dataset (clustering)
   - Textual data (translation tasks)
4. **Performance**: Achieves competitive results in tasks with structured and unstructured data, maintaining computational efficiency.
